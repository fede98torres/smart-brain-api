We also want to have a 'signin' route because well we want people to sign in and this 'signin' will most
likely be a POST request because we're posting some data some JSON, some user information, and it's going
to respond with either success or fail.

We also have a 'register' and the register again will be a POST request because we want to add the data
to the database or in our case a variable in our server and with our new user information.
So perhaps this one instead of saying 'success/fail' we will return
the newly created user to make sure that everything is working.
And we will say that this is the new user object that we'll return.

We also want in the homescreen to have an ability to access the profile of the user.
So perhaps we'll have a profile with an optional parameter of 'userId' so that each user has their own
homescreen.
And this will most likely be a GET request.
We just want to get the user information and this will return us the user. 

Perhaps we can have an image endpoint that again will be a post or maybe in our case because we're
updating the score it should be a PUT.
Because the user already exists and we want to make sure that there is an update on the user profile.
And this will just return the updated user object or perhaps whatever we've updated â€“ in our case a
count of some sort.
